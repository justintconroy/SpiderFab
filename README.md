# Summary
SpiderFab is a quadruped spider robot based on the Spider robot by @regishsu, though not a direct fork. See:

The body, legs, original firmware code, and original electronics all come from regishsu. This
makes the body a bit wider to accomodate some wider batteries. To do this, the meshes were repaired,
and then imported into OpenSCAD for modification. This design also adds a place to mount a 5x7
perfboard on top, and a GDS (Glitter Dispersal System) weapon. Both attach to the top of the
widened spider robot's body. I also made the mounts for the servos 1mm taller since the
servos I got didn't fit in @regishsu's design.
